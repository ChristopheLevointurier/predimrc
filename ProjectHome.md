PredimRc allows effective and quick pre-demensionnig of an R/C airplane or glider, and gives a realistic estimate of its overall performance. PredimRc also computes the best settings for the model, to avoid the very classic crash due to inadapted center of gravity. In this way, it can be very helpfull to verify the settings of model built from a kit or a plan.


In a first time, PredimRC will be translated in Java (please see specifications in Downloads... sorry, in french for the moment) with the same features as in the excel release... but with a much more friendly HMI. Here is a link to the original release of PredimRc (also in french) : http://www.jivaro-models.org/predim_rc/page_predim_rc.htm

In a second step, new features as 3D visualization of the model, calculus for multi-wings aircrafts, etc., will be added.
